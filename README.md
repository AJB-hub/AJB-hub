    Hello, my name is Andrew Bly.
  </p> 
  <p> 
    For the past few weeks, I've been studying with the University of Richmond's Data Analytics BootCamp.
    The rapid pace of the course has been a catalyst for great ideas, allowing for a complete restructuring
    of how I view methods and data. I feel a strong connection to these ideas, they feel like milestones for a much 
    deeper understanding that I am working towards. I will be continuing to update repositories as I develop more understanding
    for web design, data analysis, or the next big fish.
